Brainiac is a web app that classifies whether a user's mri has a tumor in it or not and if a tumor is presnet it classifies it furthe into a glioma, meningioma or a pituitary tumor.
Brainiac perfomrs classification using cnn build using Tensorflow and Keras.
Brainiac also allows 3D visualization of mri scans using the Open3D library in python
